//! MCP server surface: the tool contracts and their registration.
//!
//! This file declares *what* the tools are (their JSON schemas and the
//! thin handlers that call into `crate::tools`) and *how* they're
//! registered with rmcp. The *execution mechanics* — semaphore-bounded
//! blocking-pool dispatch, per-call tracing, and MCP progress
//! notifications — live in [`crate::server_runner`], so the tool list
//! stays a readable, declarative registry instead of a 280-line file
//! mixing schemas with worker-pool plumbing.

const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "SlugAudit does not audit. It is not an auditor and never will be: it \
    performs no risk detection, assigns no severity, draws no conclusions, and offers no \
    recommendations. Every judgment in your response — what is buggy, how severe, what to fix — \
    is entirely yours. SlugAudit's only job is to supply searchable, trustworthy evidence about a \
    codebase: parsed structure, symbols, imports, diagnostics, and prior AI-authored findings. \
    Use `report` for an automatic snapshot of what evidence exists, `query` for arbitrary \
    read-only SQL against the project's own database (search, symbol/import/diagnostic lookup, \
    dependency traversal via recursive CTEs over dependency_edges, and source retrieval all reach \
    through it), `structure` for Tree-sitter structural pattern matching, and `finding` to persist \
    a conclusion you have actually reviewed. Use `project_control` with `action` = `\"on\"` to \
    enable a project (creates the activation directory and runs the first import) or `\"off\"` to \
    disable it. Never claim SlugAudit identified, rated, or recommended anything — it cannot; \
    evidence is not judgment.";
